Daktronics RTD Sync Info

All Sport 5000 consoles have RS-232 and current-loop data outputs 
at 19200 baud 8N1. These outputs are accessible on the 25 pin connector
at the back of the console. RS232 TX is at pin 2, RX at pin 3, and ground
at pin 7. Current loop is positive on 22 and negative on 7. It's helpful
to make up a breakout box with these pins that passes all other pins through.

To use the RTD feed with this program, bring the signal from the console
into the computer on any serial port. Right now, start_dak_rs232_sync_thread
has the port hard-coded, so you need to edit that to point it at the right
port.
